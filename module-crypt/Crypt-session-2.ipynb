    "   Avoid using an algorithm or tool that is already known to have weaknesses.\n",
    "   For example: Avoid using obsolete encryption scheme (such as 3DES), because they can easily be cracked.\n",
    "   Another example: `PyCryptodome` is an up-to-date fork of the original crypto library called `PyCrypto`.\n",
    "   The former is still being actively updated, whereas its parent has not been updated for six years (as of year 2020).\n",
