`scan-hidden-neurons`: Varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer
========================================================================

This directory will contain model tuning results obtained by
varying the "hidden neurons" hyperparameter (a single-hidden-layer network model).
The tuning will be done in a Jupyter notebook.
