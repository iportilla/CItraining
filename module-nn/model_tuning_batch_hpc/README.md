Model Tuning for sherlock_18app Classifier
==========================================

This folder contains hands-on files to perform model tuning for the
sherlock_18app classifier.
The baseline model for the model tuning is a dense network
with only one hidden layer.

There are for types of hyperparameter sweeps that we do:

- `scan-hidden-neurons`: Varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer

- `scan-batch-size`: Varying the batch size

- `scan-learning-rate`: Varying the learning rate

- `scan-layers`: Varying the number of hidden layers in the model
