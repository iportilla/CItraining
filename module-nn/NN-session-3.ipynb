    "To do this, we need to identify the relevant code elements for our script.\n",
    "In a general sense, this is what we should pick out:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Useful Python libraries & user-defined functions\n",
    "* Proper sequence of commands that were run throughout this notebook (i.e. one-hot encoding must be done before training the models)\n",
    "* Code cells that require repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, once the initial experiments are done and we have established a working pipeline for machine learning, we need to change the way we work.\n",
    "Real machine learning work requires many repetitive experiments, each of which may take a long time to complete.\n",
    "Instead of running many experiments in Jupyter notebooks, where each will require us to wait for a while to finish, we need to be able to carry out many experiments in parallel so that we can obtain our results in a timely manner.\n",
    "This is key reason why we should make a script for these experiments and submit the script to run them in batch (non-interactive model).\n",
    "HPC is well suited for this type of workflow--in fact it is most efficient when used in this way.\n",
    "Here are the key components of the \"batch\" way of working:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A job scheduler (such as SLURM job scheduler on HPC) to manage our jobs and run them on the appropriate resources;\n",
    "* The machine learning script written in Python, which will read inputs from files and write outputs to files and/or standard output;\n",
    "* The job script to launch the machine learning script in the non-interactive environment (e.g. HPC compute node);\n",
    "* A way to systematically repeat the experiments with some variations. This can be done by adding some command-line arguments for the (hyper)parameters that will be varied for each experiment."
